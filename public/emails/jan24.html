      <h1>A Week in Review</h1>

      <p>
        This week I've been focusing on building my youtube brand and trying to
        put more effort into marketing my channel. I changed my youtube name
        from Web Dev Junkie to Web Dev Cody. I've been wanting to get my name in
        my channel and decided to do it before I got to 100k subscribers.
      </p>

      <p>
        One approach to improve the marketing is building out a newsletter
        management application which I can use to email my subscribers when I
        release new content. I also plan to use this newletter to promote any
        courses I may end up creating in the future.
      </p>

      <h2>A look into Astro</h2>
      <p>
        I setup a personal website using Astro. Overall, I think this framework
        easier to work with compared to Next.js. Don't get me wrong, next.js is
        great framework, but is can be a little confusing to learn at first. If
        you're looking into a simple way to create statically generated sites,
        Astro might be your solution. It has the power to create minimal
        webpages that contain zero javascript unless you manually add in
        interactivity.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're curious how I hosted my astro site using AWS amplify, checkout
        the following video:

      <h2>The Importance of Problem Solving</h2>
      <p>
        When you are first learning how to code, there are many challenges you
        will have to overcome. All of software involves problem solving. Some of
        the problems have been solved by others, but you'll still need to search
        google for those solutions and peice the puzzles together. Sometimes
        you'll run into problems you have to solve yourself. Overall, the only
        way to get great at coding is to practice solving more and more problems
        until most problems you encounter are ones you've solved in the past.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most larger problems are made up of smaller sub problems. Check out the
        following video to get a better understand of how to break down a
        problem

      <h2>Our community Dungeon Crawler is coming along</h2>

      <p>
        I spent some time this week working on a dungeon crawler game with some
        other discord users. This project has been fun to play around with and
        plan out with some other members. The main focus I've been working on is
        the inventory system. Right now we have the ability to pick up potions
        and move them between an item belt and an inventory stash.
      </p>

      <p>
        To follow along with this project, be sure to checkout my video where I
        start working on the inventory system
